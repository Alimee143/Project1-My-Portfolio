    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3>A Journey Fueled by Code, Purpose, and Persistence</h3>
    
    <p>I was born in Afghanistan, raised in displacement, and educated in resilience. My journey into computer science didn’t begin with access to the latest technology—it began with curiosity, necessity, and the belief that problem-solving could become a form of empowerment.
       Living as a refugee in India for nearly four years, I saw firsthand how barriers—language, bureaucracy, and inequality—could make even the simplest tasks difficult. 
       It was in these moments that I began to appreciate the potential of systems that worked efficiently and equitably. I didn’t just want to use technology—I wanted to build it. 
       I wanted to write code that made lives easier, processes smarter, and tools more accessible for people often left out of innovation.
       Now, as a computer science student at Georgetown University, I’m turning that drive into action. Whether I’m designing programs that handle user input validation or exploring data structures and algorithms, I approach each assignment with a deep sense of purpose. 
       I don't code just to solve textbook problems—I code to explore real-world issues, from resource management to accessibility, always asking: How can this serve others?
       What grounds my mission isn’t just academic achievement—it’s lived experience. I carry the values of my family, especially my mother who cared for my grandmother through hardship, across continents. 
       Their persistence taught me to approach challenges with patience and dignity. In the classroom, I bring the same energy: showing up prepared, collaborating with integrity, and pushing past limitations, both technical and personal.
       My portfolio is more than a showcase of projects—it's a reflection of who I am. Each line of code represents a step forward: from an under-resourced past to a future where I can build tools that make systems more just, communities more connected, and lives more empowered.
       In the world of computer science, I have found both a discipline and a direction. My mission is simple but powerful: to use code not just to create, but to contribute.</p>
